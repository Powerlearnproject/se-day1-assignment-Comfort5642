Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products through systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools. 

In the technology industry, software engineering enables the creation of systems and applications that power key aspects of modern life such as commerce, healthcare and communication. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages such as C
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline
3. The advent of structured programming and the rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements -  gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2. Design - creating high-level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation - involves writing code and building the software
4. Testing - involves conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment - releasing the software to its end users or customers
6. Maintenance - entails providing ongoing support through updates and enhancements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 The waterfall methodology involves the chronological approach with distinct phases that flow downwards, while the agile methodology is iterative and incremental and focuses on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. 

 The waterfall methodology is appropriate for a rigid system with well-defined requirements and minimal client involvement. The agile methodology is appropriate for dynamic systems that value adaptability and require frequent client feedback. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer writes code and implements software solutions
2. Quality Assurance Engineer ensures quality by designing and executing test plans
3. A project manager is involved in the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs such as VS Studio and Eclipse provide writing tools 
VCS such as Git and Subversion provide tools for tracking changes to the source code and are used in coordinating teamwork 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Requirements - can be solved by adopting agile methodologies
2. Tight deadlines - can be solved through task prioritization and proper planning
3. Technical debt - can be solved through regular reassessments of the project goals and timelines 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing - tests individual components 
2. Integration Testing - tests interactions between different components and subsystems
3. System Testing - tests entire systems as a whole
4. Acceptance Testing - tests software systems against user requirements. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting questions and statements to get the best responses from AI models. 
Prompt engineering improves interactions between humans and AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt - What are taxes?
Improved prompts - what kind of taxes does a salaried employee have to pay every month?

The improved promppt provides a definite answer to a defined question as opposed to a general explanation of all types of taxes, both relevant and irrelevant
